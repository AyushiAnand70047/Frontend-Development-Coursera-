Welcome to Programming
1. The zeros and ones of binary code is a low-level language because it's closer to being understood by a CPU. JavaScript on the other hand is a high-level language. This means that it has to be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with it.
-> True

9. There are various uses of the Boolean data type, one of which is to compare various values and types and it is used in conjunction with various operators such as the strict equality operator. True or false: the strict equality operator only checks for value and not type as well.  
-> False (The strict equality operator which is three equal signs is used to check for value and type.  )

Conditional and loops
1. An if statement can be used to run code based on a condition being true.    
-> True

2. You need to execute code based on a certain condition being either true or false. Which of the following types of statements can you use to complete this task? Select all that apply.

5. True or false: A while loop will keep looping through a code block as long as a specified condition is true?  
-> True

6. You are running multiple nested loops within your JavaScript code. Could these nested loops cause performance issues with your code?
