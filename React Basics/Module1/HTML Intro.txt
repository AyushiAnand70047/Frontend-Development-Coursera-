HTML 
HTML is used to describe the structure of Web pages. Developers use HTML elements with their opening and closing tags to “mark up” an HTML document. 

This means that an HTML document must be represented in a way that JavaScript code can query and update it. And that's the function of the DOM. It's a model of the objects in your HTML file.
web developers interact with the DOM through JavaScript to update content, set up events and animate HTML elements.
